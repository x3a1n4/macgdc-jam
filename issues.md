# Issues
- When jumping multiple times, state machine breaks (should probably switch over to a blendspace)
- Make it so that you can't fullscreen

Todo:
	Expand puzzle so that you need to use information from outside
		Switch dialogue out for interactables
	Expand puzzle to use environmental clues
		
	Make ending screen fade on (add it to scene rather than scene change)
	Add more grass

Playtest
	Playtester feels like they're missing context (fair)
		- Mention in the dialogue to just follow the path for now [tentatively fixed]
	Got the spacebar indicator and it didn't fade off [high]
	You re-get the wasd thing when changing zones [high]
	
	Went to see if anything happened if you wnet outside again
	- Dialogue retriggers
	
	Wanted to see if it was the same inkblot on both
	- Tried to look at the ink pot
	Was looking for non-citizens 
	- Need to make the other points much more obscure and incorigable
	- Need a confirm on the people coming in and people leaving
	- Are the surnames anagrams
	Thought you needed to see all the dialogue
	- Tried to "decode" the names (looking at first letter, etc)
	
	Make intakes not constrained to :15 increments
	Make r input only show up once you interact with dead guy
Todo: 
	Add some sort of post (telephone post) where you can check in to see if you have more to find [tentatively fixed]
	- This should be a reocurring element
	- This is also how intro dialogue is delivered
	- You just sit on a rock and ask
	
	Add something outside to the tune of "out, please wait for guard to come back" [tentatively fixed]
	- Add visible queue
	
	Add more inkblots to the names-obscure unneeded info!!! [low]
	
	- Fix calendar element sizing (it looked a bit cursed with one hour) [tentatively fixed]
	
	Add jump particles, glide particles, death particles 
	- Nope, nope, done
